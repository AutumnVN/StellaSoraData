Rain in the morning, then sun.\nI must record this day, lest the Monolith erases it from my memory.\"\n\nI once devised a meticulous plan to run away.\nI set out at dawn, covering my tracks across three rest stops. It was the boldest, most defiant thing I had ever done as Master's student.\nBut sunset came and Master never descended to drag me back. Had she even noticed I was gone?\nSo under the cover of darkness, I crept back into the courtyard. Seeing the lamp lit in her room, I relaxed. I stashed my pack in my room and went to bid her goodnight, just like always.\nI watched her face, searching for any sign of anger. She seemed normal—until she met my gaze. I knew I was in trouble.\n\"You're back. Had fun out there?\"\nSpeechless, I could only kneel before her. After what felt like an eternity, she finally set down her teacup.\n\"Consider today's little trip an exercise in stealth.\"\n\"Your skills, however, are abysmal. You could have been found at any moment. You need more practice.\"\nI couldn't believe it. She wasn't scolding me. Then she said something that would stay with me forever.\n\"But you left without my permission. As punishment, I will also disappear one day, when you least expect it.\"\n\nI don't remember how I got through that agonizing night. I only remember the crushing fear that Master might actually disappear.\nLater, as if in a trance, I stumbled to my desk. A wave of regret poured onto the page as I wrote a long letter of apology.\n\nFor seven days, she ignored me. She no longer oversaw my training or cared if I slept in. Terrified, I could do nothing but pen apology after apology.\nThen, on the eighth morning, I slid open my door to find her standing there, her long disciplinary ruler in hand, ready to oversee my exercises.\nI thought she must have forgiven me.\n\nI held onto that belief, right up until the day she told me she'd been assigned a top-secret mission by our organization.\nIn the years that followed, Master's missions grew more perilous as her standing in the organization rose. Whenever she was away, I trained relentlessly, no longer the lazy child I once was, hoping I could one day ease her burden.\nI expected her to return in a few days, a fortnight at most, just as she always had.\nShe once told me this courtyard was the only place she trusted, the only place she felt safe. A ninja has no home, but this place was ours.\nBut this time, she didn't return. I searched the entire courtyard, but found no farewell letter.\nI have to believe this is just her punishment—the one she promised me all those years ago.\nI am still waiting for her to come back.\n\n—\n\nBefore I left, I looked in on her. She was already asleep, assuming I was just off on another mission.\nMy mind drifted back to that night years ago—a little girl tiptoeing over the wall, trying to act casual as she entered my room. I remembered how her eyes filled with tears after I threatened her.\nFor seven days after, a letter appeared on my desk each morning. The first was a long, formal apology. The latter ones grew messy, the handwriting of a child fighting off sleep.\nThe letter on the seventh day was on a damp slip of paper. On it was a single sentence.\n\"Master, don't go.\"\n\nThe truth is, I had forgiven her long ago.",

I never saw them either.\nBut this one flower, a dissonant note in a grand symphony, was growing secretly in the shadows.\nI figured the gardener had either overlooked it or perhaps planted it themselves. It might be a quiet interlude in his arduous routine.\n\nNow, it has become a small diversion in my daily life. During my lunch break, I walk the stone path in the backyard—a relaxation technique my mentor taught me for sorting through my thoughts and planning my next steps.\nOn those walks, I used to imagine catching an outlaw scaling the wall, giving me the perfect excuse to challenge him to a duel.\nI knew I shouldn't indulge such pointless fantasies. The golden age of duelist advocates was over. I had to become a competent advocate. That was what the Poitou family needed now.\nThese days, I make a point of stopping by that flowerbed on my walks, just to be sure the flower is still there.\nI grew curious about its name, but my knowledge of botany was limited to what I'd learned in school nature class.\nPerhaps it was a rare flower, a precious one sprouted from a seed dropped by a passing bird.\n\nThat evening, I pulled a heavy botanical encyclopedia from our library.\nI flipped through it from cover to cover but found no trace of my flower.\n\"Could I have discovered a new species?\"\nI shared the exciting news with my mother, who listened to my description with a puzzled look.\nShe took the encyclopedia, turned directly to a page, and pointed to a tiny, unremarkable white flower in the corner.\n\"Darling, is this the one?\"\nI stared at the picture, comparing it again and again with the flower so vivid in my head. It was, without a doubt, the same one.\nI had been in such a hurry that I'd overlooked the entry tucked away in the page's crease. Its description was only a few sentences long.\nStill, I couldn't accept it. \"But if it's as common as the book says, why have I never seen one before?\"\nMother smiled as if answering the simplest question a child could ask.\n\"Flowers that are too ordinary aren't planted in formal gardens.\"\n\"I saw them while vacationing at our country estate. They covered the hillsides. Quite beautiful, in their own way.\"\n\nLater, I finally saw that scenery for myself.\nI had just come through a rather disgraceful episode in my life and set off on a solo journey.\nAfter a rain shower, I was wandering aimlessly through the countryside when I saw it by the roadside—the very flower etched in my memory.\nAs I knelt for a closer look, a girl's voice called out from behind me.\n\"Oh! You like Starspots, too?\"\nI looked up and erupted into a brilliant smile. Her short orange hair shone against the overcast sky, and I remembered the heavy encyclopedia.\n\"Starspots? I know them as Ground Pimpernels.\"\n\"Oh, that's probably the official name. We Trekkers call them Starspots.'Cause they're scattered everywhere like little stars. Their juice makes good herbal medicine, too.\"\nThe book never told me that this utterly ordinary flower wasn't entirely useless.\n\"Thank you. I see.\"\n\"No problem! I'm delivering a letter to the next town. We could walk together if you're headed that way.\"\n\"I don't really know where I'm going... So, why not? I'll go with you.\"",

I'm in a garden.\"\n\"A garden? What flowers grow there? Are they in full bloom or have they withered?\"\n\"Um...\"\nHer little lie crumbles under such precise questioning. Nanoha keeps her eyes tightly shut, waiting for her master's criticism.\n\"The heart of spiritual training lies in honest self-reflection. Deceiving yourself will lead you nowhere.\"\n\"As part of the Tanikaze, we must face harsh realities. Without the ability to create a mental haven from this world, you'll find the coming days unbearable.\"\n\"This differs from your usual training—take your time with it.\"\nWhile the words' true meaning remains beyond Nanoha's grasp, she notices something surprising—her master's voice carries no hint of reprimand.\n\"But tell me, this 'garden' you spoke of—is it like the one in our courtyard?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nIn her panic, her mind reaches instinctively for that tiny, desolate flower bed. Where sunflowers once reached for the sky, only withered stalks and fragile leaves remain.\nShe often loses herself staring at the dried seeds in the flower heads, imagining how magnificent the sunflowers must have been in full bloom.\n\nAs dusk settles on the following day, Nanoha returns to find the garden soil upturned, the broken sunflowers nowhere to be seen.\nHer heart skips a beat as she hears her master's faint voice coming from behind,\n\"Starting today, you shall take care of the flower bed—watering, tending to seedlings, all of it.\"\nThat summer, she finally sees it—a sea of flowers in full bloom.\nThe once-barren earth is now awash with newborn gold. She has built her own secluded world, soft and steadfast as the soil itself.\n\nYears later, when Nanoha leaves the courtyard, she carefully seals away every fragment of her past.\n\nIt isn't until the organization sends her to care for an injured senior that she steps back into this long-forgotten courtyard of memories.\nThe senior, who once had brief dealings with her master, sighs,\n\"This garden is truly lovely. I visited a handful of times ... back when you were still a little one.\"\n\"I even suggested to your master that the place could use some flowers. And yet, it remains unchanged.\"\nHer breath catches, \"...We grew sunflowers once.\"\n\"That can't be right. Your master said the organization prohibited any changes to the courtyard—it needed to look abandoned. I've been visiting nearly every year, and I've never once seen sunflowers.\"\n\nIn the golden-lit room, Nanoha runs through the possibilities again and again.\nClimbing the Monolith makes one forget.\nBut when did those memories of sunflowers first take root in her mind?\nAre they real? Or fabricated?\nCould they be self-created, nothing but an ethereal dream?\nShe wishes to believe the senior is the one with missing memories, that everything really happened.\nBut as she was taught long ago, she cannot deceive herself. The only person who could prove the truth—who taught her to dig, to plant, to water—has disappeared.\nOnly by finding her can all secrets be revealed.\nShe must find her.\n\nShe rises and steps into the sunlight.\nThe next journey might have no end.",

Right, got it.\"\n\"You purchased a few onigiris three days ago and felt unwell after eating them last night.\"\n\"May I ask if you took any preservation measures after bringing them home?\"\nHer logic cuts through the argument like a finely honed sword.\n\"Given the recent heat, food left at room temperature easily spoils. To be precise, you cannot definitively prove the shop is at fault. Maybe just be more careful next time.\"\n\nThe crowd scatters as rain begins to fall. Still leaning against the railing, Chitose feels electric anticipation coursing through her: a desire to test her mettle against this advocate.\nDeep within, she knows that crossing swords with this one would hone her own edge.\nYet the other bears no arms, and for a \"blade\" to challenge such would be both unjust and uncouth.\nAs she suppresses the urge to issue a challenge, the advocate seems to sense her presence, lifting her gaze to meet Chitose's directly.\nEven through the curtain of rain, those crimson eyes burn like a freshly tempered katana—fierce and ardent.\n\n\nTwo years later, Chitose's journey of self-training reaches a temporary pause.\nShe settles in an abandoned waystation, rarely visited by people, and names it the \"Pavilion of Rain's Whispers.\"\nThis morning, as she senses the coming rain in the air, she ponders ways to welcome wandering Trekkers.\nAs predicted, the afternoon unleashes a tempest. Howling winds and stinging debris threaten to tear the roof off.\nThrough the gloom, a figure struggles against the wind and rain.\n\"Might you seek shelter beneath this humble roof?\"\nWielding her slender tachi, Chitose performs her distinctive welcome ritual, one that typically sends visitors fleeing in terror.\nYet this time, a battle-axe clashes against her blade with a deafening shriek.\n\"I'll have to pass. My journey awaits. Thank you for the gesture.\"\nIn the gleaming reflection of crossed blades, a pair of crimson eyes stares back.\nEcstasy courses through her veins as she tightens her grip, instantly entering the state of Psyche.

She stormed up to Amber, locked eyes with her and snapped:\n\"Why are you watching me?\"\nShock, confusion, panic—all flickered in Amber's gaze. Then, slowly, her face reddened.\n\"W-what's that supposed to mean...\" Karin grew flustered as well. The sun beat down on her face, and she felt hotter and hotter.\n\n\"Amber, Karin—what are you two chatting about?\"\n\"Eh? Why are your faces so red? They remind me of watermelons!\"\n\"See you later.\" And with that, Amber just bolted.\n\"Hey! What do you mean by that!\"\nBut Karin's demand went unanswered. She stared after Amber, unaware of the \"danger\" closing in behind her.\n\"Ow—my ear! Let go! Now!\"\n\"Yay! I got her ears! Iris, you come try it, too!\"\n\"Noya, maybe this isn't such a good idea...\"\n\"It's a terrible idea! Just what do you think I am?!\"\nKarin fought back, but Noya was far too strong. Out of options, she finally shouted the words she'd been holding back all this time:\n\"Shia—Shia—stop playing with them—\"\n\"Come save meeee!!\""
