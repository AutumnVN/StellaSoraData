  "StarTowerNPC.9133.2": "In the convenience stores scattered throughout the Monolith, you'll always find Portia, who often sits lazily behind the counter, dark circles under her eyes from lack of sleep, responding to customers' requests with a half-hearted tone.\nIt's not difficult to strike up a conversation with her, despite her usual unenthusiasm. Mention \"the world beyond the Monolith,\" and you'll see the subtle wobble of expectation and curiosity in her eyes. Maybe she's really interested in knowing more about it?",

  "StarTowerNPC.9172.2": "When a battle ends, you'll find Beatrixa in front of the stairs with her medical kit. She is the very \"Angel of the Monolith\" that people talk about.\nShe never starts a conversation, so many Trekkers never even notice her. She always wears a cold expression and sounds like she's unhappy that you're hurt. Yet, regardless of her attitude, she always heals every Trekker's injuries and reminds them to stay safe. So, maybe she's actually a great caretaker?",
