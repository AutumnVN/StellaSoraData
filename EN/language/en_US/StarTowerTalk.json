  "StarTowerTalk.913302.2": "Ugh, this is so annoying. Why do I have to be here...?",
  "StarTowerTalk.913303.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913303.2": "Hmm? You were talking to me? I thought it was a dream...",
  "StarTowerTalk.913304.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913304.2": "Just grab anything you want, as long as you pay.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913305.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913305.2": "You can take as much as you want from the Monolith, but is that really good for you Trekkers...? I wonder... Heh...",
  "StarTowerTalk.913306.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913306.2": "So tired... I need some sleep right now... Be my guest.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913307.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913307.2": "Shhh... If the manager catches me chatting with a customer, I'll be fined.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913308.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913308.2": "You're looking good, way better than me. I say you should be working here at the Monolith.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913309.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913309.2": "You want my advise? Come on, I just work here.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913310.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913310.2": "Speaking of which, you play games? Let's play a round then.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913311.1": "Portia",

  "StarTowerTalk.913313.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913313.2": "Just leave the Stella Coins on the table to pay.\nI need to finish this game first.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913314.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913314.2": "Pick something useful, yeah? I don't want to see you all bruised and battered next time.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913315.1": "Portia",

  "StarTowerTalk.913322.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913322.2": "You're interested in the manager? It'll talk to you when it feels like it, and if it doesn't ... then it's in a bad mood.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913323.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913323.2": "Tell me more about what's happening outside the Monolith. I'd really appreciate it.\nA discount? Ugh, that's out of my hands...",
  "StarTowerTalk.913324.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913324.2": "Why do you Trekkers climb the Monolith anyway?\nFor the Artifacts, really?",
  "StarTowerTalk.913325.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913325.2": "Thank you for shopping with us.\nNow I can pass the time by counting these Stella Coins when there's no one around to talk to...",

  "StarTowerTalk.913328.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913328.2": "Come back again if you're satisfied with your purchase. I'd be bored out of my mind if you don't.",
  "StarTowerTalk.913329.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913329.2": "Feel free to take a rest here if you're feeling tired.\nWant something to drink?",
  "StarTowerTalk.913330.1": "Portia",
  "StarTowerTalk.913330.2": "Sometimes I'd also like to see what's outside the Monolith... Hah, I should stop talking nonsense.",

  "StarTowerTalk.917206.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917206.2": "Don't waste my time. Let me treat you and you're good to go.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917207.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917207.2": "That's not very serious. Keep moving.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917208.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917208.2": "Good, still alive. How many shots this time?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917209.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917209.2": "I only treat Trekkers here. If you think you've seen me somewhere else, then that's probably a mistake.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917210.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917210.2": "I've never known anyone who pesters me for shots like you.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917211.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917211.2": "I'm not here to tend to you only... So, where's the injury?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917212.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917212.2": "Be more careful next time. Just try to make my life easier, would you?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917213.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917213.2": "Good, you did better than I had expected. Come, let's do a checkup.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917214.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917214.2": "Streaming? Did you hit your head?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917215.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917215.2": "Alright, alright. One shot coming up. Don't rush.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917216.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917216.2": "You're good to go. Leave and don't be in my way.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917217.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917217.2": "I don't take in the wounded here. Sorry, you can't stay.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917218.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917218.2": "No need to push yourself so hard. It's okay to turn back if it gets too tough.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917219.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917219.2": "What? You're addicted to my shots?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917220.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917220.2": "It's normal to get hurt, but honestly, you're pretty fragile.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917221.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917221.2": "Was that scream just acting? Not bad at all.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917222.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917222.2": "I don't do inpatient care here. You can leave once you're treated.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917223.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917223.2": "You may die if you keep going up... Whatever, not my problem.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917224.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917224.2": "Quite athletic. Looks like you'll survive a few more rounds.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917225.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917225.2": "I don't provide any other services here.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917226.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917226.2": "If you want to rest here a while, be my guest. Just leave me alone.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917227.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917227.2": "I don't mind giving you more help. Just come back to me the next time you're hurt.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917228.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917228.2": "If your goal's the top, don't linger here.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917229.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917229.2": "Just here to chat for a bit? Fine by me.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917230.1": "Beatrixa",
  "StarTowerTalk.917230.2": "Hmm, I'm starting to expect more from you.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917301.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917301.2": "Risk and reward always go hand in hand...",
  "StarTowerTalk.917302.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917302.2": "Don't fight it. Strength belongs to those brave enough to seek it.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917303.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917303.2": "Want more rewards? Try this one~",
  "StarTowerTalk.917304.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917304.2": "Fortune favors the bold!\nIsn't that what you Trekkers always say?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917305.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917305.2": "No more boring constraints! Yield to your desires!",
  "StarTowerTalk.917306.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917306.2": "Lucky day, eh? Why not challenge your fate now?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917307.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917307.2": "Once you've decided, don't hesitate~",
  "StarTowerTalk.917308.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917308.2": "My great Boss, don't you want the grandest prize?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917309.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917309.2": "A deal? Don't make it sound so cold. I just took care of that little bit of greed inside you.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917310.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917310.2": "Since you're here, why not play a game with me?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917311.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917311.2": "Come on. Make your choice! As long as you leave everything to me, I will satisfy all your desires...",
  "StarTowerTalk.917312.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917312.2": "Took you long enough.\nI've been here waiting for you, my great Boss! And I'll give you a really, really good time.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917313.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917313.2": "Caught my attention the moment you stepped into the Monolith... I've been so fascinated by your explicit desire.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917314.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917314.2": "Are you sure you can trust me? My sweet words and gentle gestures ... can well be traps for you to fall...",
  "StarTowerTalk.917315.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917315.2": "I'm in a great mood today! Ask me for anything, and I will grant it!",
  "StarTowerTalk.917316.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917316.2": "Want another round? \nSorry, one game at a time~",
  "StarTowerTalk.917317.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917317.2": "So, happy now?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917318.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917318.2": "Mmm~ Still not satisfied, are you?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917319.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917319.2": "You're not going without a hug, are you?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917320.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917320.2": "Keep climbing~ We'll meet again!",
  "StarTowerTalk.917321.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917321.2": "You're addicted, huh? Look forward to the next time we meet then.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917322.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917322.2": "Don't look so reluctant to leave. You'll still have plenty of chances.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917323.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917323.2": "Stop searching... I don't have anything better to offer...",
  "StarTowerTalk.917324.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917324.2": "May Lady Fortune always smile on you, my great Boss.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917325.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917325.2": "Already hooked? You're so adorable.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917326.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917326.2": "Wonderful! I prefer people who know what they want over indecisive ones.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917327.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917327.2": "If I let you pat on my horn ... will you be happy?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917328.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917328.2": "Want to continue chatting for a while? Stay here then. We can do this forever...",
  "StarTowerTalk.917329.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917329.2": "The idea that I'll meet you again makes the job less boring.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917330.1": "Bernina",
  "StarTowerTalk.917330.2": "I really like your scent ... of desire.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917401.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917401.2": "A choice without risks is like gambling without betting — completely worthless.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917402.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917402.2": "Those Trekkers who go down in history weren't all that special. Most of the time, they just made the right choice.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917403.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917403.2": "A single wise decision can save countless wasted efforts. Work smarter, not harder...",
  "StarTowerTalk.917404.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917404.2": "One never regrets the outcome, but rather the chances they never take.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917405.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917405.2": "To make it this far, you truly are an impressive Trekker.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917406.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917406.2": "Indecision won't lead to greatness.\nAs an experienced Trekker, you must understand the importance of acting decisively.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917407.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917407.2": "The right choice always beats undirected effort. That's the first rule of survival in the Monolith, don't you think?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917408.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917408.2": "A seasoned Trekker like you should be able to make the best choice.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917409.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917409.2": "No need to fear. All it'll cost is you an entrance ticket.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917410.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917410.2": "Reaching this place is no small feat. Please continue to strive on the road ahead!",
  "StarTowerTalk.917411.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917411.2": "A mature Trekker like you wouldn't hesitate like a novice, right?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917412.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917412.2": "Just follow your heart, and you'll become the brightest star in the Monolith's history!",
  "StarTowerTalk.917413.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917413.2": "Look, the rewards are right before you... So, why not aim for greater prizes?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917414.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917414.2": "A true Trekker makes every choice a road sign along their journey.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917415.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917415.2": "If you feel lost, close your eyes and listen to the voice within.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917416.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917416.2": "Cutting your losses is the smart thing to do.\nBut a true Boss never quits halfway, right?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917417.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917417.2": "Everyone should follow their heart. I'm only offering a little advice.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917418.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917418.2": "Opportunities slip away in an instant. If you want to try again ... I'll always be here.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917419.1": "Virigia",

  "StarTowerTalk.917421.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917421.2": "Don't worry, this is only a small obstacle.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917422.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917422.2": "If the reward is tempting enough, it's worth staking everything, isn't it?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917423.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917423.2": "Your time is precious. You must have more important things to attend to, don't you?",
  "StarTowerTalk.917424.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917424.2": "Lady Luck will smile upon you — if not this time, then next time, yeah.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917425.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917425.2": "Don't miss great opportunities for small gains, and don't throw away what's within reach for empty dreams.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917426.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917426.2": "I'll be keeping an eye on your destiny.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917427.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917427.2": "The cost itself isn't scary. What's really upsetting is wasted effort. But at least, it's become our little secret now.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917428.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917428.2": "If a quick chat could help you reach your goal, I'd be happy to spend some time with you.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917429.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917429.2": "Opportunities only come to those who are ready. I hope to see you again soon.",
  "StarTowerTalk.917430.1": "Virigia",
  "StarTowerTalk.917430.2": "That courage you have, facing hardship head-on... It's truly fascinating."
